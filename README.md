# bm -- The Bookmark utility

I'm tired of typing `cd /go/src/github.com/jackkklika/bm` or whatever to go to a repo. What if I could type `bm bm` after defining it once?

Usage:
`bm [alias]` -- If [alias] points to a directory, it will cd to that directory. If [alias] points to a file, it will open that file in vim.
